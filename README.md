# Spam Mail Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project focuses on implementing a robust spam mail prediction system utilizing Logistic Regression, a popular algorithm in machine learning. Spam mail continues to be a persistent issue in modern communication platforms, and this project aims to address it through predictive modeling techniques.

The core of the project revolves around feature extraction from text data. By employing various feature extraction methods, the model can identify crucial patterns and characteristics within the email content that distinguish spam from legitimate messages. These methods include techniques like bag-of-words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and potentially more sophisticated methods such as word embeddings.

Logistic Regression serves as the primary classification algorithm due to its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability. Through iterative training on labeled datasets, the model learns to classify emails as either spam or non-spam based on the extracted features.
